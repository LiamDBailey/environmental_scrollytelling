# environmental_scrollytelling
Our repo for the environmental scrollytelling project

## General goal:
We want to contextualise the issue of how Germany is progressing on decarbonisation, and potentially place this within a European.

## What do we need:
- Spatial data on coal mining/consumption sites in Germany
- Subsidy data for fossil fuels/renewables
- Coal consumption for Germany
- Germany legislation on climate policy
- Investment of Germany companies in coal related projects (maybe focus on the five major power companies)
